My name is Moritz A. Zanger. I am a fourth year Ph.D. student under the supervision of Prof. Matthijs T.J. Spaan and Dr. Wendelin BÃ¶hmer at the Sequential Decision Making group at the TU Delft (Netherlands). Prior to this, I received a Master of Science (w. distinction) in Mechanical Engineering from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (Germany).

My research focuses on efficient uncertainty estimation in deep reinforcement learning, a topic I consider crucially important in making AI more trustworthy and reliable. I am, however, interesed in most things related to reinforcement learning and deep learning. For example, I am excited about recent algorithms in unsupervised reinforcement learning and generative applications of RL, like generative flow networks.
